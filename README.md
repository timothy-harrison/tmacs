# Tmacs: A wrapper for Gromcas

## Written by Timothy Harrison, RMIT

The learning curve for gramcas is incredibly steep. With continued use, I have found myself using it pretty easily. I wrote this wrapper mainly for educational purposes, however, with continual updates I am hoping to expand it so I can use it for my purposes.

It is written in Go using the !(Bubble Tea)[https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master] framework.
